# Users Preference Graph

This project uses Python to generate random user data, focusing on preferences related to how AI should respond. Examples of these preferences include response length (short or detailed), format (bulleted lists or paragraphs), and tone (formal or casual). The data is uploaded to a Neo4j database, enabling efficient relationship mapping. When a new user queries the system, it analyzes existing preferences to suggest AI response styles that are similar and likely to align with the new user's preferences.
